# ClimateChangeVespulaNZ
Assessing the impact of climate change on invasive Vespulid wasps in Aotearoa

"distModelNativeRange.R" describes the species distribution model fitted for Vespula germanica in its native range (Europe) which is then projected to NZ under firstly current climate conditions and secondly for a range of projected future climates. "EuropeBioClims.tif" and "NZBioClims.tif" are climate data used for current distributions, "ssp245_2041_2060.tif","ssp245_2081_2100.tif","ssp585_2041_2060.tif","ssp585_2081_2100.tif" are projected climate data for future distributions.
