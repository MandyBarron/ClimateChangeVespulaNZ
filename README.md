# ClimateChangeVespulaNZ
Assessing the impact of climate change on invasive Vespulid wasps in Aotearoa

"SDMVespGermCurrentFutureClimsNZ.R" describes the species distribution model fitted for Vespula germanica in its native range (Europe) which is then projected to NZ under firstly current climate conditions and secondly for a range of projected future climates using the WorldClim (https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html) bioclimatic variables). "EuropeBioClims.tif" and "NZBioClims.tif" are the bioclimate data used for current distributions and "ssp245_2041_2060.tif", "ssp245_2081_2100.tif", "ssp585_2041_2060.tif", "ssp585_2081_2100.tif" are the projected bioclimate data for future distributions.
"VespFutureDensityPropnOW.R" is used to project current and future Vespula vulgaris nest density based on spring rainfall and the current and future proportion of V. germanica nests overwintering based on autumn air temperatures. Climate data for NZ past and projected future climates supplied by NIWA (proprietary data so not included here).
